This section introduces how to re-host a removed member cluster to another host cluster.

== Unbinding a Cluster in Normal State

If a member cluster is removed while in a normal state, no additional operations are required. The member cluster can be directly re-hosted by another host cluster. For detailed steps, please refer to link:../01-add-a-member-cluster[Add a Member Cluster].

== Unbinding a Cluster in Abnormal State

If a member cluster is removed while in an abnormal state, run the following command on the member cluster to clear the hosting information. After that, the cluster can be normally re-hosted by another host cluster.

[,bash]
----
kubectl patch ns kubesphere-system --type merge -p '{"metadata":{"annotations": null}}'

== Clean Up Multi-Cluster Configuration Data

After a cluster is unbound, the original resources and multi-cluster configuration data in the cluster will not be automatically cleared. If the unbound cluster has workspace-related configurations, run the following command to manually clean up the configuration data in the removed cluster before re-hosting.

[,bash]
----
for ns in $(kubectl get ns --field-selector status.phase!=Terminating -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do kubectl label ns $ns docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/workspace- && kubectl patch ns $ns --type merge -p '{"metadata":{"ownerReferences":[]}}'; done
