This section describes how to add a member cluster via agent connection.

If the host cluster cannot access the Kubernetes API service of the member cluster, you can set the member cluster to connect to the **tower** service exposed by the host cluster to add the member cluster.


== Prerequisites

* You should have the **platform-admin** role on the host cluster.

* **KubeSphere Multi-Cluster Agent Connection** should have been installed and enabled.

* All nodes of the member cluster must be able to access the external access address of the **tower** service of the host cluster. Depending on your network environment, you may need to configure firewall and traffic forwarding rules.

== Set Proxy Service Address

After installing the "KubeSphere Multi-Cluster Agent Connection" extension on the host cluster, a service named `tower` will be automatically created in the system project `kubesphere-system`.


=== If Cluster Has Available LoadBalancer

If there is an available LoadBalancer plugin in the host cluster, executing the following command on the host cluster node will show that the `tower` service has the corresponding `EXTERNAL-IP` address. This address will be automatically obtained and configured by KubeSphere as the proxy service address, which means you can skip the step of setting the proxy service address.

Run the following command to confirm if there is a LoadBalancer plugin.

[,bash]
----
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc
----

The output may be as follows:

[,bash]
----
NAME       TYPE            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)              AGE
tower      LoadBalancer    10.233.63.191   139.198.110.23  8080:30721/TCP       16h
----

|
Mainstream public cloud providers generally provide LoadBalancer solutions, and load balancers can automatically allocate external IPs. If your cluster runs in a local environment, especially in a bare-metal environment, you can use link:https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/openelb[OpenELB] as the load balancer solution.

=== If Cluster Does Not Have Available LoadBalancer

If there is no available LoadBalancer in the host cluster, executing the `kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc` command may result in the following output.

[,bash]
----
NAME       TYPE            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)              AGE
tower      LoadBalancer    10.233.63.191   <pending>       8080:30721/TCP       16h
----

Since the `EXTERNAL-IP` is in the `pending` state, you need to manually set the proxy address by adding the value of `proxyPublishAddress` to the `kubesphere-config` ConfigMap.

. On the host cluster node, run the following command to open the `kubesphere-config` ConfigMap.
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl -n kubesphere-system edit cm kubesphere-config
----

. Search for `multicluster` and add a new line to define the external IP address of the tower service for accessing Tower.
+
--
[,bash]
----
multicluster:
  clusterRole: host
  proxyPublishAddress: {Public IP Address}:{Port} # Add this line to set the address to access tower
----

You may need to configure port forwarding rules, such as forwarding Public IP:Port to NodeIP:NodePort.

== Add Member Cluster

include::../../../_custom-en/platformManagement/multiclusterManagement/clusters/clusters-oper-logInToHost.adoc[]

+

. Click **Cluster Management**.

+
include::../../../_custom-en/platformManagement/multiclusterManagement/clusters/clusters-oper-addClusterBasicInfo.adoc[]
+
Under **Advanced Settings**, set the identifier for the cluster.

. On the **Connection Settings** tab, set the **Connection Method** to **Agent Connection** and click **Next**.

. On the **Cluster Configuration** tab, set the cluster configuration, then click **Create**.
+
--
After the member cluster is added, it will be displayed in the cluster list on the **Cluster Management** page.
