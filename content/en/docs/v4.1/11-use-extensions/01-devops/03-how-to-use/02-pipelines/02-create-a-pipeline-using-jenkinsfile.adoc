A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline and is checked into a source code control repository. As it stores the entire workflow as code, the Jenkinsfile forms the basis for code reviews and pipeline iterations. For more information, refer to the link:https://www.jenkins.io/zh/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/[Jenkins Documentation].

This document demonstrates how to create a pipeline based on a Jenkinsfile from a GitHub repository.


[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
DevOps supports creating two types of pipelines: pipelines created based on a Jenkinsfile in SCM as described in this document, and link:../01-create-a-pipeline-using-graphical-editing-panel/[pipelines created through the graphical editing panel].

The Jenkinsfile in SCM requires an internal Jenkinsfile in Source Control Management (SCM), meaning the Jenkinsfile must be part of the SCM. The DevOps system automatically builds the CI/CD pipeline based on the existing Jenkinsfile in the code repository. By defining workflows such as **stage** and **step**, specific build, test, and deployment requirements can be met.
|===

== Prerequisites

* **DevOps** must have been installed and enabled.

* You have a link:https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub] account and a link:https://github.com[GitHub] account.

* A workspace, a DevOps project, and a user (e.g. **project-regular**) have been created, and the user has been invited to the DevOps project with the **operator** role. Refer to link:../../05-devops-settings/02-role-and-member-management[Role and Member Management].

* A dedicated CI node has been set up to run pipelines. Refer to link:../../05-devops-settings/04-set-ci-node[Set CI Nodes for Dependency Cache].

* SonarQube has been installed and configured (optional). Refer to link:../../../04-how-to-integrate/01-sonarqube/[Integrate SonarQube into Pipelines]. If you skip this, the **SonarQube Analysis** stage will be omitted.

== Pipeline Overview

This example pipeline consists of the following stages:

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
| Note

|
* **Stage 1: Checkout SCM**: Fetch the source code from the GitHub repository.

* **Stage 2: Unit Test**: It will not proceed with the next stage until the test is passed.

* **Stage 3: SonarQube Analysis**: The SonarQube code quality analysis.

* **Stage 4: Build and Push**: Build an image based on the selected branches in **Strategy Settings** and push the **SNAPSHOT-$BRANCH_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER** tag to Docker Hub, where **$BUILD_NUMBER** is the run ID of the record in the pipeline run records.

* **Stage 5: Push Latest**: Tag the `v4.1.0-sonarqube` branch as **latest** and push it to Docker Hub.

* **Stage 6: Push with Tag**: Generate a tag and release it to GitHub, which will be pushed to Docker Hub.
|===


== Step 1: Create Credentials

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console as the **project-regular** user.

. Click **Workspace Management** and navigate to your DevOps project. Under **DevOps Project Settings**, create the following credentials in the **Credentials** page. For more information on creating credentials, refer to link:../../05-devops-settings/01-credential-management[Credential Management].
+
--

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
| Note

|
If your account or password contains special characters such as **@** and **$**, errors may occur during pipeline runs due to unrecognized characters. In such cases, encode your account or password on a third-party website (e.g., link:https://www.urlencoder.org[urlencoder]) and then copy and paste the encoded result as your credential information.
|===

[%header,cols="1a,2a,2a"]
|===
| Credential ID | Type | Where to use

| dockerhub-id
| Username and Password
| Docker Hub

|github-id
| Username and Password
| GitHub
|===
--

. Create another credential for SonarQube (**sonar-token**) for Stage 3 (Code Analysis). Choose the credential type **Access Token** and enter the SonarQube token in the **Token** field. Refer to link:../../../04-how-to-integrate/01-sonarqube/#_create_a_sonarqube_token_for_the_new_project[Create a SonarQube Token for the New Project]. Click **OK** to complete the process.

. You also need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the permissions shown in the following image. Then, in the DevOps project, use the generated token to create account credentials for GitHub authentication (e.g., **github-token**).
+
--
image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/devops-user-guide/use-devops/create-a-pipeline-using-a-jenkinsfile/github-token-scope.png[,100%]

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
To create a GitHub Personal Access Token, go to your GitHub account's **Settings**, click **Developer settings**, select **Personal access tokens**, and then click **Generate new token**.
|===
--

. Once created, you will see the credentials on the credentials page.


== Step 2: Modify the Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository

. Log in to GitHub and fork all branches of the repository link:https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/devops-maven-sample[devops-maven-sample] to your personal GitHub account.

. In your GitHub repository **devops-maven-sample**, switch to the `v4.1.0-sonarqube` branch and click on the file **Jenkinsfile-online** in the root directory.

. Click the edit icon on the right to edit the environment variables.

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
In the Jenkinsfile, the **-o** parameter for the **mvn** command enables offline mode. Relevant dependencies have been downloaded in this tutorial to save time and accommodate network disruptions in certain environments. Offline mode is enabled by default.
|===
--

. After editing the environment variables, click **Commit changes** to update the file in the `v4.1.0-sonarqube` branch.


== Step 3: Create a Pipeline

. Log in to {ks_product-en} web console as the **project-regular** user.

. Click **Workspace Management** and navigate to your DevOps project. Click **Pipelines** and then click **Create**.

. In the pop-up dialog, name it **jenkinsfile-in-scm**.

. Under **Pipeline Type**, select **Multi-branch Pipeline**.

. Under **Code Repository**, choose a code repository and click **Next** to proceed.
+
--
If there are no available code repositories, click **Create a code repository** below. For more information, see link:../../04-import-code-repositories/[Import Code Repositories].
--

.. In the **Import Code Repository** dialog, enter a custom code repository name and click **Select a code repository**.

.. On the **GitHub** tab, select **github-token** from the **Credential** dropdown menu and click **OK**.

.. In the GitHub list, select your GitHub account, and all repositories associated with that token will be listed on the right. Choose **devops-maven-sample** and click **Select**.

.. Click **OK** to select your code repository.

. In **Advanced Settings**, check **Delete outdated branches**. In this tutorial, it is recommended to leave **Branch Retention Period (days)** and **Maximum Branches** at their default values.
+
--
Delete outdated branches means that you will discard the branch record all together. The branch record includes console output, archived artifacts and other relevant metadata of specific branches. Fewer branches mean that you can save the disk space used by Jenkins. KubeSphere provides two options to determine when old branches are discarded:

* Branch Retention Period (days). Branches that exceed the retention period are deleted.

* Maximum Branches. The earliest branch is deleted when the number of branches exceeds the maximum number.


[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
**Branch Retention Period (days)** and **Maximum Branches** apply to branches at the same time. As long as a branch meets the condition of either field, it is deleted. For example, if you specify 2 as the retention period and 3 as the maximum number of branches, any branch that exceed either number is deleted. DevOps prepopulates these two fields with 7 and 5 by default respectively.
|===
--

. In **Strategy Settings**, DevOps offers four strategies by default. You can delete **Discover PRs from Forks**, as this strategy will not be used in this example. For other strategies, no need to change the setting and you can use the default value directly.
+
--

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
To enable **Strategy Settings** here, you should select GitHub as the code repository.
|===

As a Jenkins pipeline runs, the Pull Request (PR) submitted by developers will also be regarded as a separate branch.

**Discover Branches**

* **Exclude branches field as PRs**. The source branch is not scanned such as the origin's master branch. These branches need to be merged.
* **Include only branches filed as PRs**. Only scan the PR branch.
* **Include all branches**. Pull all the branches from the repository origin.

**Discover PRs from Origin**

* **Pull the code with the PR merged**. A pipeline is created and runs based on the source code after the PR is merged into the target branch.
* **Pull the code at the point of the PR**. A pipeline is created and runs based on the source code of the PR itself.
* **Create two pipelines respectively**. Two pipelines are created, one is based on the source code after the PR is merged into the target branch, and the other is based on the source code of the PR itself.
--

. Scroll down to **Script Path**, set it to **Jenkinsfile-online**, which is the file name of Jenkinsfile in the example repository located in the root directory. The field specifies the Jenkinsfile path in the code repository. It indicates the repository's root directory. If the file location changes, the script path also needs to be changed. 

. In **Scan Trigger**, select **Scan periodically** and set the interval to **5 minutes**. Click **Create** to finish.
+
[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
You can set a specific interval to allow pipelines to scan remote repositories, so that any code updates or new PRs can be detected based on the strategy you set in **Strategy Settings**.
|===


== Step 4: Run the pipeline

. After a pipeline is created, click its name to go to its details page.
+
--

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
* On the **Pipelines** list page, click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg[more,18,18] on the right of the pipeline, and select **Copy** to create a duplicate of that pipeline.

* To simultaneously run multiple pipelines that do not include multibranch configurations , select these pipelines on the **Pipelines** list page and click **Run** to run them in bulk.

* The **Sync Status** on the pipeline details page shows the synchronization result between KubeSphere and Jenkins. If the synchronization is successful, it will display **Successful** along with a green checkmark icon.

|===
--

. Under **Run Records**, multiple branches are being scanned. Click **Run** on the right and the pipeline runs based on the behavioral strategy you set. Select **v4.1.0-sonarqube** from the drop-down list and add a tag number such as `v0.0.2`. Click **OK** to trigger a new run.
+
--

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
* If you do not see any run records on this page, you need to refresh your browser manually or click **More > Scan Repository**.

* The tag name is used to refer to the newly generated release and image in GitHub and Docker Hub. Existing tag names cannot be reused for the **TAG_NAME** field. Otherwise, the pipeline will not be running successfully.
|===
--

. Wait for a while, click run records to view details.
+
--

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
Activity failures may be caused by different factors. In this example, only the Jenkinsfile of the branch `v4.1.0-sonarqube` is changed as you edit the environment variables in the steps above. While, these variables in the v4.1.0 branch remain unchanged (namely, wrong GitHub and Docker Hub account). If you choose v4.1.0 branch to run, it will result in a failure. Other reasons for failures may be network issues, incorrect coding in the Jenkinsfile and so on.

In the **Run Logs** tab on the run record details page, you can view detailed information of the logs to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
|===
--

. If the pipeline reaches the **Push with Tag** stage, it will pause at this point and require a user with approval permissions to click **Proceed**.
+
--
In a development or production environment, it requires someone who has higher permissions (for example, release manager) to review the pipeline, images, as well as the code analysis result. They have the authority to determine whether the pipeline can go to the next stage. In the Jenkinsfile, you use the section `input` to specify who reviews the pipeline. If you want to specify a user (for example, `project-admin`) to review it, you can add a field in the Jenkinsfile. If there are multiple users, you need to use commas to separate them as follows:

[,bash]
----
input(id: 'release-image-with-tag', message: 'release image with tag?', submitter: 'project-admin,project-admin1')
----
--

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console with a user with pipeline approval permissions. Click **Workspace Management** and navigate to your DevOps project. Click the pipeline name to access its details page. Under the **Run Records** tab, click the record you want to review, then click **Proceed** to approve the pipeline.
+
[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
In KubeSphere, if you do not specify a reviewer, the user that can run a pipeline will be able to continue or terminate the pipeline. Additionally, the pipeline creator, users with the project administrator role, or any accounts specified by you also have the authority to continue or terminate the pipeline.
|===

== Step 5: Check Pipeline Status

. Under the **Pipeline** tab in the run records, check the running status of the pipeline. The pipeline may take a few minutes to initialize when first created. 
// The sample pipeline consists of eight stages, each defined separately in the link:https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/devops-maven-sample/blob/sonarqube/Jenkinsfile-online[Jenkinsfile-online].

. Click the **Run Logs** tab to view the pipeline's running logs. Click each stage to view detailed logs. Click **View Full Logs** to troubleshoot and resolve issues based on the logs, and you can also download the logs for further analysis.

== Step 6: Verify Results

. After a successful pipeline run, click **Code Check** to view the code analysis results provided by SonarQube. This page will be unavailable if SonarQube has not been configured beforehand. 

. Following the definitions in the Jenkinsfile, the Docker image built by the pipeline has been successfully pushed to Docker Hub. In Docker Hub, you will see an image with the tag **v0.0.2**, specified before the pipeline runs.

. At the same time, a new tag and a new release have been generated in GitHub.
