[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a distributed, community-driven, and 100% open-source search and analytics suite licensed under Apache 2.0. It can be used for real-time application monitoring, log analysis, website search, and more.

OpenSearch is backed by the Apache Lucene search library and supports a range of search and analysis features such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) search, SQL, anomaly detection, Machine Learning Commons, Trace Analytics, full-text search, and more. 

OpenSearch provides a highly scalable system, allowing users to explore their data easily through integrated visualization tools.

Starting from KubeSphere v3.4.0, OpenSearch v1 and v2 are integrated into it and set as the default backend storage for the `logging`, `events`, and `auditing` components.

## Prerequisites

- You need a user with cluster management permissions. For example, you can log in to the console directly with the `admin` user or create a role with cluster management permissions and assign it to a user.

- Before adding a log receiver, you need to enable the `logging`, `events`, or `auditing` components. For more information, see [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../../pluggable-components/). This tutorial enables `logging` as an example.

## Use OpenSearch as a Log Receiver

In KubeSphere v3.4.0 and later, OpenSearch is the default backend storage for `logging`, `events`, or `auditing` components. Configure as follows:

```shell
$ kubectl edit cc -n kubesphere-system ks-installer

apiVersion: installer.docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterConfiguration
metadata:
  name: ks-installer
  namespace: kubesphere-system
spec:
  common:
    opensearch:   # Storage backend for logging, events, and auditing.
      enabled: true
      logMaxAge: 7             # Log retention time in built-in Opensearch. It is 7 days by default.
      opensearchPrefix: whizard      # The string making up index names. The index name will be formatted as ks-<opensearchPrefix>-logging.
```

For KubeSphere versions below `v3.4.0`, please [upgrade](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/ks-installer-carryon/tree/release-3.4#upgrade) first.

### Enable Logging via the Console and Use OpenSearch as the Backend Storage

1. Log in to the console as the `admin` user, click **Platform** in the upper left corner, and select **Cluster Management**.

2. Click **CRDs**, enter `clusterconfiguration` in the search bar, and click the search result to view its detailed page.

3. Under **Custom Resources**, click the three dots on the right side of `ks-installer`, select **Edit YAML**.

![](/images/docs/v3.x/cluster-administration/cluster-settings/log-collections/cc-ks-installer.png)

4. In the YAML file, search for `logging`, change the `enabled` from `false` to `true`. After that, click **OK** in the lower-right corner to save the configuration.

  ```yaml
  common:
    opensearch:
      enabled: true
      
  logging:
    enabled: true
  ```

## Change Log Storage to External OpenSearch and Disable Internal OpenSearch

If you are using KubeSphere's internal OpenSearch and want to change it to your external OpenSearch, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to update the cluster configuration:

  ```shell
  kubectl edit cc -n kubesphere-system ks-installer
  ```

2. Set `opensearch:externalOpensearchHost` to the address of your external OpenSearch and set `opensearch:externalOpensearchPort` to its port. Comment or delete the `status:logging` field. Here is an example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: installer.docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/v1alpha1
  kind: ClusterConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: ks-installer
    namespace: kubesphere-system
  spec:
    common:
      opensearch:
        enabled: true
        externalOpensearchHost: ""
        externalOpensearchPort: ""
        dashboard:
          enabled: false
  status:
     # logging:
       #  enabledTime: 2023-08-21T21:05:13UTC
       #  status: enabled
  ```

  If you want to use the visualization tools of `OpenSearch`, set `opensearch.dashboard.enabled` to `true`.

3. Run the following command to restart `ks-installer`.

  ```shell
  kubectl rollout restart deploy -n kubesphere-system ks-installer
  ```

4. Run the following command to delete the internal OpenSearch. Make sure you have backed up the data in it.

  ```shell
  helm uninstall opensearch-master -n kubesphere-logging-system && helm uninstall opensearch-data -n kubesphere-logging-system && helm uninstall opensearch-logging-curator -n kubesphere-logging-system
  ```

## Query Logs in KubeSphere

1. All users can use the log query feature. Log in with an account, hover over the icon in the lower right corner, and select Log Query from the pop-up menu.

2. In the pop-up window, you can see the time histogram of the number of logs, the cluster dropdown list, and the log search bar.

![](/images/docs/v3.x/cluster-administration/cluster-settings/log-collections/logging-dashboard.png)

3. Click on the search bar and search for logs by message, workspace, project, resource type, resource name, reason, category, or time range (e.g., enter the time range: last 10 minutes to search for logs in the last 10 minutes). Alternatively, click on the bar in the time histogram, and KubeSphere will show logs in the time range of that bar.
