The API changes of the component **logging** in KubeSphere 3.3.

## Time Format

The time format of query parameters must be Unix timestamps (the number of seconds that has elapsed since the Unix epoch). Milliseconds are no longer allowed. The change affects the parameters `start_time` and `end_time`.

## Deprecated APIs

The following APIs are removed:

- GET  /workspaces/{workspace}
- GET  /namespaces/{namespace}
- GET  /namespaces/{namespace}/workloads/{workload}
- GET  /namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{pod}
- The whole log setting API group

## Fluent Operator

In KubeSphere 3.3, the whole log setting APIs are removed from the KubeSphere core since the project Fluent Operator is refactored in an incompatible way. Please refer to [Fluent Operator docs](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/fluentbit-operator) for how to configure log collection in KubeSphere 3.3.
