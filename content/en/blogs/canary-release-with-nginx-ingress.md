An increasing number of applications are running in cloud-native environments nowadays. Application developers have to effectively develop, build, test, and release their cloud-native applications while minimizing errors in code and reducing impacts on users. One way to address this challenge is to implement canary releases.

This article gives a quick look on the concept of canary release, and then focuses on how to implement a canary release in Kubernetes with Nginx Ingress.

## What is Canary Release

### Overview

Canary release is an application deployment method that makes new application features available to a limited portion of users. Canary release is widely adopted in the process of continuous delivery for a variety of benefits, such as:

- Rollout control: Rollout control can be realized over the new application version by allowing a small subset of users to use the canary release before a complete rollout.
- Easy rollback: Rollback can be quickly implemented in case of any bugs or issues.
- Real-world testing: With canary release, real-world testing can be conducted in a small scale without exposing all users to potential bugs or issues.

### Canary Release with Nginx Ingress

[Nginx Ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.21.0) has brought a new feature of canary annotations. You can use these canary annotations to configure multiple backend services for your gateway entry and to control traffic allocations. After you set `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"` for an Ingress, you can use the following annotations for canary rules:

- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight`
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-cookie`

{{< notice note >}}

The above rules will be assessed according to the priority sequence: `canary-by-header > canary-by-cookie > canary-weight`. For more information, see [this document](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#canary).

{{</ notice >}}

Generally, the above rules can be divided into the following two categories:

- Weight-based canary release rules

- User-based canary release rules

## Canary Release in Kubernetes with Nginx Ingress

Now, how to implement a canary release in Kubernetes with Nginx Ingress? Let's do a weight-based one together.

### Prerequisites

To prepare a Kubernetes cluster, you can refer to [this blog](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/blogs/install-kubernetes-using-kubekey/). In this article, let's set up a Kubernetes cluster with KubeSphere installed.

### Enable Cluster Gateway

1. Log in to the KubeSphere web console as `admin`. Go to **Platform > Cluster Management > Cluster Settings > Gateway Settings** and click **Enable Gateway** on the **Cluster Gateway** tab.

2. In the displayed dialog box, select the **NodePort** access mode for the gateway and click **OK**.

3. You can view the details of the gateway on the page.

### Create an application

1. Let's create a namespace first.

   ```bash
   kubectl create ns ingress-demo
   ```

2. Create a YAML file `production.yaml` with the following content.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: production
     labels:
       app: production
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: production
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: production
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: production
           image: mirrorgooglecontainers/echoserver:1.10
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
           env:
             - name: NODE_NAME
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: spec.nodeName
             - name: POD_NAME
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.name
             - name: POD_NAMESPACE
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.namespace
             - name: POD_IP
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: status.podIP
   
   ---
   
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: production
     labels:
       app: production
   spec:
     ports:
     - port: 80
       targetPort: 8080
       protocol: TCP
       name: http
     selector:
       app: production
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply it.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f production.yaml -n ingress-demo
   ```

### Create an ingress

Since the application is ready now, let's create an Ingress for it.

1. Create a file `production.ingress` with the following content.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: production
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: docs.kubesphere-carryon.top
       http:
         paths:
         - backend:
             serviceName: production
             servicePort: 80
   ```

2. Run the following command to apply it.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f production.ingress -n ingress-demo
   ```

3. Run the following command to access the application.

   ```bash
   $ curl --resolve docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141:192.168.2.2 docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141
   
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   
   Pod Information:
   	node name:	qkcp
   	pod name:	production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   	pod namespace:	ingress-demo
   	pod IP:	10.233.96.107
   
   Server values:
   	server_version=nginx: 1.13.3 - lua: 10008
   
   Request Information:
   	client_address=10.233.96.105
   	method=GET
   	real path=/
   	query=
   	request_version=1.1
   	request_scheme=http
   	request_uri=http://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:8080/
   
   Request Headers:
   	accept=*/*
   	host=docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141
   	user-agent=curl/7.29.0
   	x-forwarded-for=192.168.2.2
   	x-forwarded-host=docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141
   	x-forwarded-port=80
   	x-forwarded-proto=http
   	x-forwarded-scheme=http
   	x-real-ip=192.168.2.2
   	x-request-id=5f525b4511d9b4ba7f86f2ed9c90ab5f
   	x-scheme=http
   
   Request Body:
   	-no body in request-
   ```

   {{< notice note >}}

   `192.168.2.2` is the gateway address of the project `ingress-demo` and `32141` is the node port. You need to replace them with the actual values from your environment.

   {{</ notice >}}

### Create a canary version of the application

Next, let's create a canary version of the application to implement a canary release.

1. Create a YAML file `canary.yaml` with the following content.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: canary
     labels:
       app: canary
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: canary
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: canary
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: production
           image: mirrorgooglecontainers/echoserver:1.10
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
           env:
             - name: NODE_NAME
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: spec.nodeName
             - name: POD_NAME
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.name
             - name: POD_NAMESPACE
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.namespace
             - name: POD_IP
               valueFrom:
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: status.podIP
   
   ---
   
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: canary
     labels:
       app: canary
   spec:
     ports:
     - port: 80
       targetPort: 8080
       protocol: TCP
       name: http
     selector:
       app: canary
   ```

2. Run the following command to apply it.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f canary.yaml -n ingress-demo
   ```

### Set a weight-based canary release

1. Create a file `weighted-canary.ingress` with the following content.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: canary
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "30"
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: docs.kubesphere-carryon.top
       http:
         paths:
         - backend:
             serviceName: canary
             servicePort: 80
   ```

2. Run the following command to apply it.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f weighted-canary.ingress -n ingress-demo
   ```

3. Run the following command to verify the weight-based canary release.

   {{< notice note >}}

   Although we set 30% traffic to the canary version of the application, the actual traffic ratio may fluctuate to a small extent.

   {{</ notice >}}

   ```shell
   for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s --resolve docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141:192.168.2.2 docs.kubesphere-carryon.top:32141 | grep "Hostname"; done
   ```

   The output may look as follows:

   ```
   Hostname: canary-c66cf4f8c-zntfs
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: canary-c66cf4f8c-zntfs
   Hostname: production-5d84fbdb58-964mq
   Hostname: canary-c66cf4f8c-zntfs
   ```

4. The weight-based canary release is implemented. If you want to use other annotations for canary rules, you can add annotations to the ingress on the KubeSphere web console.

## Canary release on KubeSphere

Based on [Istio](https://istio.io/), KubeSphere provides users with necessary control to deploy canary services. All the canary configurations can be made on its wizard web console. For more information, see [Canary Release](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/docs/project-user-guide/grayscale-release/canary-release/).
