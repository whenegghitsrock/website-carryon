**[KubeEye](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/kubeeye) is an open-source diagnostic tool for identifying various Kubernetes cluster issues automatically, such as misconfigurations, unhealthy components and node failures**. It empowers cluster operators to manage and troubleshoot clusters in a timely and graceful manner. Developed in Go on the basis of [Polaris](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris) and [Node Problem Detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector), KubeEye is equipped with a series of built-in rules for exception detection. Besides pre-defined rules, KubeEye also supports customized rules.

## Why Open Source

As the de facto standard in container orchestration, Kubernetes features a powerful and flexible architecture which supports various cloud-native add-ons. That said, there are some obstacles and problems which have haunted cluster operators and engineers for so long, such as:

- CPU, memory or disk exceptions

- Kernel deadlock and filesystem damage

- Container runtime daemon not responding

- Unhealthy etcd

- Request and limit blackbox

- Pod failures

- Certificates expiring

- Docker service failures
- OOM (Out of Memory)

In fact, the problems listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. The majority of the cluster issues lies below the surface as they are not directly detectable from the cluster control plane. **In other words, even with these potential issues, Kubernetes may continue to schedule Pods onto malfunctioning nodes, thus posing a greater threat to the stability and security of your cluster**.

To identify these issues in time, the [KubeSphere](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock) team developed KubeEye with over three years of expertise in Kubernetes cluster management and maintenance in production for both community users and commercial customers.

## What Can KubeEye Do

- Identify and detect problems in your Kubernetes cluster control plane, including `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager` and `etcd`.

- Identify and detect various node problems, including memory, CPU and disk pressure, and unexpected kernel issues.

- Validate YAML specifications of your workloads for best practices and compliance in the industry, thus improving cluster stability.

## KubeEye Architecture

By calling the Kubernetes API, KubeEye gets diagnostic data as it matches key error messages in logs with rules of container syntax on a regular basis. See the architecture graph below:

   ```

## Add Custom Check Rules

In addition to the pre-defined diagnostic items and rules, KubeEye also supports customized rules. For example:

   1. Make sure you have installed NPD.

      ```bash
      ke install npd
      ```

   2. Edit its ConfigMap using Kubectl.

      ```bash
      kubectl edit cm -n kube-system node-problem-detector-config
      ```

   3. Add regular expression rules in the ConfigMap for exceptional logs.

## Customize Best Practice Rules

   1. Create a rule in YAML. For example, the rule below checks your Pod specification to make sure images only come from the authorized registry.

      ```yaml
      checks:
        imageFromUnauthorizedRegistry: warning
      
      customChecks:
        imageFromUnauthorizedRegistry:
          promptMessage: When the corresponding rule does not match, show that image from an unauthorized registry.
          category: Images
          target: Container
          schema:
            '$schema': http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema
            type: object
            properties:
              image:
                type: string
                not:
                  pattern: ^quay.io
      ```

   2. Save the file, such as `rule.yaml`.

   3. Run KubeEye with the YAML file.

      ```bash
      $ ke diag -f rule.yaml --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
      NAMESPACE     SEVERITY    NAME                      KIND         TIME                        MESSAGE
