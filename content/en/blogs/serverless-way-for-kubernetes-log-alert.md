## Overview

How do you handle container logs collected by the message server? You may face a dilemma: Deploying a dedicated log processing workload can be costly, and it is difficult to assess the number of standby log processing workloads required when the quantity of logs fluctuates sharply. This blog post offers ideas for serverless log processing, which reduces the link cost while improving flexibility.

Our general design idea is to add a Kafka server as a log receiver, and then use the log input to the Kafka server as an event to drive the serverless workloads to handle logs. Roughly, the following steps are involved:

1. Set up a Kafka server as the log receiver for Kubernetes clusters.
2. Deploy OpenFunction to provide serverless capabilities for log processing workloads.
3. Write log processing functions to grab specific logs to generate alerting messages.
4. Configure [Notification Manager](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/notification-manager/) to send alerts to Slack.

In this scenario, we will make use of the serverless capabilities of[ OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction).

> [OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction) is an open-source FaaS (serverless) project initiated by the KubeSphere community. It is designed to allow users to focus on their business logic without the hassle of caring about the underlying operating environment and infrastructure. Currently, the project provides the following key capabilities:
> 
> - Builds OCI images from Dockerfile or Buildpacks.
> - Runs serverless workloads using Knative Serving or OpenFunctionAsync (backed by KEDA + Dapr) as a runtime.
> - Equipped with a built-in event-driven framework.

## Use Kafka as a Log Receiver

First, enable the **logging** component for the KubeSphere platform (For more information, please refer to[ Enable Pluggable Components](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/docs/pluggable-components/). Next, we can use [strimzi-kafka-operator](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator) to build a minimal Kafka server.

1. In the `default` namespace, install [strimzi-kafka-operator.](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator)
   
   ```shell
   helm repo add strimzi https://strimzi.io/charts/
   helm install kafka-operator -n default strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator
   ```

2. Run the following commands to create a Kafka cluster and a Kafka topic in the `default` namespace. The storage type of the created Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters is **ephemeral**. Here, we use `emptyDir` for demonstration.
   
   > Note that we have created a topic named `logs` for follow-up use.
   
   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
   kind: Kafka
   metadata:
     name: kafka-logs-receiver
     namespace: default
   spec:
     kafka:
       version: 2.8.0
       replicas: 1
       listeners:
         - name: plain
           port: 9092
           type: internal
           tls: false
         - name: tls
           port: 9093
           type: internal
           tls: true
       config:
         offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
         transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
         transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
         log.message.format.version: '2.8'
         inter.broker.protocol.version: "2.8"
       storage:
         type: ephemeral
     zookeeper:
       replicas: 1
       storage:
         type: ephemeral
     entityOperator:
       topicOperator: {}
       userOperator: {}
   ---
   apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
   kind: KafkaTopic
   metadata:
     name: logs
     namespace: default
     labels:
       strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-logs-receiver
   spec:
     partitions: 10
     replicas: 3
     config:
       retention.ms: 7200000
       segment.bytes: 1073741824
   EOF
   ```

3. Run the following command to check the Pod's status and wait until Kafka and ZooKeeper runs and starts.
   
   ```shell
   $ kubectl get po
   NAME                                                   READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
   kafka-logs-receiver-entity-operator-568957ff84-nmtlw   3/3     Running       0          8m42s
   kafka-logs-receiver-kafka-0                            1/1     Running       0          9m13s
   kafka-logs-receiver-zookeeper-0                        1/1     Running       0          9m46s
   strimzi-cluster-operator-687fdd6f77-cwmgm              1/1     Running       0          11m
   ```
   
   Run the following command to view metadata of the Kafka cluster:
   
   ```shell
   # Starts a utility pod.
   $ kubectl run utils --image=arunvelsriram/utils -i --tty --rm
   # Checks metadata of the Kafka cluster.
   $ kafkacat -L -b kafka-logs-receiver-kafka-brokers:9092
   ```

Add this Kafka server as a log receiver.

1. Log in to the web console of KubeSphere as **admin**. In the upper-left corner, choose **Platform** > ****Cluster Management****.
   
   > If you have enabled the [multi-cluster feature](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/docs/multicluster-management/), you need to select a cluster.

2. On the ****Cluster Management**** page, click **Log Collections** under ****Cluster Settings****.

3. Click **Add Log Receiver,** and then click **Kafka**. Enter the service address and port number of Kafka, and then click ****OK****.

![add-log-receiver](/images/blogs/en/Serverless-way-for-Kubernetes-Log-Alerting/add-log-receiver.png)

4. Run the following commands to verify that Kafka clusters can collect logs from Fluent Bit.
   
   ```shell
   # Starts a utility pod.
   $ kubectl run utils --image=arunvelsriram/utils -i --tty --rm 
   # Checks logs in the `logs` topic
   $ kafkacat -C -b kafka-logs-receiver-kafka-0.kafka-logs-receiver-kafka-brokers.default.svc:9092 -t logs
   ```

## Deploy OpenFunction

According to the design in Overview, we need to deploy OpenFunction first. As OpenFunction has referenced multiple third-party projects, such as Knative, Tekton, ShipWright, Dapr, and KEDA, it is cumbersome if you manually deploy it. It is recommended that you refer to [Prerequisites](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction#prerequisites) to quickly deploy dependencies of OpenFunction.

> In the command, `--with-shipwright` means that Shipwright is deployed as the build driver for the function; `--with-openFuncAsync` means that OpenFuncAsync Runtime is deployed as the load driver for the function. When you have limited access to GitHub and Google, you can add the `--poor-network` parameter to download related components.

```shell
sh hack/deploy.sh --with-shipwright --with-openFuncAsync --poor-network
```

Deploy OpenFunction.

> We install the latest stable version here. Alternatively, you can use the development version. For more information, please refer to the[ Install OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction#install) section.
> 
> To make sure that Shipwright works properly, we provide a default build policy, and you can run the following commands to set the policy.
> 
> ```shell
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/main/config/strategy/openfunction.yaml
> ```

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction/releases/download/v0.3.0/bundle.yaml
```

## Write a Log Processing Function

In this example, we install WordPress as the log producer. The application's workload resides in the `demo-project` namespace and the Pod's name is `wordpress-v1-f54f697c5-hdn2z`.

When a request returns **404**, the log content is as follows:

```json
{"@timestamp":1629856477.226758,"log":"*.*.*.* - - [25/Aug/2021:01:54:36 +0000] \"GET /notfound HTTP/1.1\" 404 49923 \"-\" \"curl/7.58.0\"\n","time":"2021-08-25T01:54:37.226757612Z","kubernetes":{"pod_name":"wordpress-v1-f54f697c5-hdn2z","namespace_name":"demo-project","container_name":"container-nrdsp1","docker_id":"bb7b48e2883be0c05b22c04b1d1573729dd06223ae0b1676e33a4fac655958a5","container_image":"wordpress:4.8-apache"}}

```

Here are our needs: When a request returns **404**, the Notification Manager sends a notification to the receiver (Configure a Slack alert receiver according to [Configure Slack Notifications](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/docs/cluster-administration/platform-settings/notification-management/configure-slack/), and records the namespace, Pod name, request path, request method, and other information. Therefore, we write a simple function:

> You can learn how to use `openfunction-context` from [OpenFunction Context Spec,](https://github.com/OpenFunction/functions-framework/blob/main/docs/v0.3.0/OpenFunction-context-specs.md) which is a tool library provided by OpenFunction for writing functions. You can learn more about OpenFunction functions from [OpenFunction Samples.](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples)

```go
package logshandler

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"regexp"
	"time"

	ofctx "github.com/OpenFunction/functions-framework-go/openfunction-context"
	alert "github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/template"
)

const (
	HTTPCodeNotFound = "404"
	Namespace        = "demo-project"
	PodName          = "wordpress-v1-[A-Za-z0-9]{9}-[A-Za-z0-9]{5}"
	AlertName        = "404 Request"
	Severity         = "warning"
)

// The ctx parameter of the LogHandler function provides a context handle for user functions in the cluster. For example, ctx.SendTo is used to send data to a specified destination.
// The in parameter in the LogsHandle function is used to pass byte data (if any) from the input to the function.
func LogsHandler(ctx *ofctx.OpenFunctionContext, in []byte) int {
	content := string(in)
	// We set three regular expressions here for matching the HTTP status code, resource namespace, and Pod name of resources, respectively.
	matchHTTPCode, _ := regexp.MatchString(fmt.Sprintf(" %s ", HTTPCodeNotFound), content)
	matchNamespace, _ := regexp.MatchString(fmt.Sprintf("namespace_name\":\"%s", Namespace), content)
	matchPodName := regexp.MustCompile(fmt.Sprintf(`(%s)`, PodName)).FindStringSubmatch(content)

	if matchHTTPCode && matchNamespace && matchPodName != nil {
		log.Printf("Match log - Content: %s", content)

		// If the input data matches all three regular expressions above, we need to extract some log information to be used in the alert.
		// The alert contains the following information: HTTP method of the 404 request, HTTP path, and Pod name.
		match := regexp.MustCompile(`([A-Z]+) (/\S*) HTTP`).FindStringSubmatch(content)
		if match == nil {
			return 500
		}
		path := match[len(match)-1]
		method := match[len(match)-2]
		podName := matchPodName[len(matchPodName)-1]

		// After we collect major information, we can use the data struct of altermanager to compose an alert.
		notify := &alert.Data{
			Receiver:          "notification_manager",
			Status:            "firing",
			Alerts:            alert.Alerts{},
			GroupLabels:       alert.KV{"alertname": AlertName, "namespace": Namespace},
			CommonLabels:      alert.KV{"alertname": AlertName, "namespace": Namespace, "severity": Severity},
			CommonAnnotations: alert.KV{},
			ExternalURL:       "",
		}
		alt := alert.Alert{
			Status: "firing",
			Labels: alert.KV{
				"alertname": AlertName,
				"namespace": Namespace,
				"severity":  Severity,
				"pod":       podName,
				"path":      path,
				"method":    method,
			},
			Annotations:  alert.KV{},
			StartsAt:     time.Now(),
			EndsAt:       time.Time{},
			GeneratorURL: "",
			Fingerprint:  "",
		}
		notify.Alerts = append(notify.Alerts, alt)
		notifyBytes, _ := json.Marshal(notify)

		// Use ctx.SendTo to send the content to the "notification-manager" output (you can find its definition in the following logs-handler-function.yaml function configuration file.
		if err := ctx.SendTo(notifyBytes, "notification-manager"); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		log.Printf("Send log to notification manager.")
	}
	return 200
}

```

Upload this function to the code repository and record the ****URL of the code repository**** and the **path of the code in the repository**, which will be used in the **Create a function** step.

> You can find this case in [OpenFunction Samples](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/logs-handler-function).

## Create a Function

Use OpenFunction to build the above function. First, set up a key file `push-secret` to access the image repository (After the OCI image is constructed using the code, OpenFunction will upload the image to the image repository for subsequent load startup.):

```shell
REGISTRY_SERVER=https://index.docker.io/v1/ REGISTRY_USER=<your username> REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<your password>
kubectl create secret docker-registry push-secret \
    --docker-server=$REGISTRY_SERVER \
    --docker-username=$REGISTRY_USER \
    --docker-password=$REGISTRY_PASSWORD
```

Apply the function configuration file `logs-handler-function.yaml`.

> The function definition explains the use of two key components:
> 
> [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) shields complex middleware from applications, making it easy for the `logs-handler` function to handle Kafka events.
> 
> [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) drives the startup of the `logs-handler` function by monitoring event traffic in the message server, and dynamically extends the `logs-handler` instance based on the consumption delay of Kafka messages.

## Demonstrate the Result

Disable the Kafka log receiver first: On the ****Log Collections**** page, click **Kafka** to go to the details page, and choose **More** > **Change Status** > **Close**.

Wait for a while, and then it can be observed that number of instances of the `logs-handler` function has reduced to 0.

Then set the status of the Kafka log receiver to **Collecting**, and `logs-handler` also starts.

```shell

```

Next, initialize a request for a non-existent path of the WordPress application:

```shell
curl http://<wp-svc-address>/notfound
```

You can see that Slack has received this message (Slack will not receive an alert message when we visit the WordPress site properly).

![](https://i.imgur.com/YQc5uOq.png)

### Explore More Possibilities

We can further discuss a solution using synchronous functions:

To use Knative Serving properly, we need to set the load balancer address of its gateway. (You can use the local address as a workaround.)

```bash
# Repalce the following "1.2.3.4" with the actual values.
$ kubectl patch svc -n kourier-system kourier \
-p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer", "externalIPs": ["1.2.3.4"]}}'

$ kubectl patch configmap/config-domain -n knative-serving \
-type merge --patch '{"data":{"1.2.3.4.sslip.io":""}}'
```

OpenFunction drives the running of the `Knative` function in two ways: (1) Use the Kafka server in asynchronous mode; (2) Use its own event framework to connect to the Kafka server, and then operate in Sink mode. You can refer to the case in [OpenFunction Samples](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/knative/logs-handler-function).

In this solution, the processing speed of synchronous functions is lower than that of asynchronous functions. We can also use KEDA to trigger the concurrency mechanism of Knative Serving, but it is not as convenient as asynchronous functions. (In the future, we will optimize the OpenFunction event framework to make up for the shortcomings of synchronous functions.)

It can be seen that different types of serverless functions have their unique advantages depending on task scenarios. For example, when it comes to handling an orderly control flow function, a synchronous function outperforms an asynchronous function.

## Summary

Serverless matches our expectations for rapid disassembly and reconstruction of business scenarios.

As you can see in this case, OpenFunction not only increases flexibility of log processing and alert notification links by using the serverless technology, but also uses a function framework to simplify complex setups typically required to connect to Kafka into semantically clear code. Moreover, we are also continuously developing OpenFunction so that components can be powered by our own serverless capabilities in follow-up releases.
