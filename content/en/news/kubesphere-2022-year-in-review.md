In 2022, we've witnessed cloud native technology shifts from boom to mature, and an increasing number of projects with tech inche start emerging and provide backbone for cloud native apps in full lifecycle. Technology such as infrastructure as code (IaC), microservices, and serverless architecture automates provisioning and makes infrastructure resources flexible. At the same time, the development of open source tends to go stable after reaching a saturation point.

All together, our KubeSphere open source community has also found its stride and grown at a constant pace.

Let's take a look back at the milestones and stories of the KubeSphere community over the past year, and we appreciate all the members who have contributed.

## Trends for Open Source Projects

In 2022, KubeSphere has reached a milestone of more than 10,000 GitHub stars. Here, we thank you all for your contribution of any type to our community, from code, issues, to docs, as well as experience sharing in cloud native practices. Any help means a lot to us!

On top of KubeSphere, our other open source projects also moved ahead steadily. In April 2022, our OpenFunction project was accepeted to CNCF and is at the Sandbox project maturity level. By year's end, we had two open source projects OpenELB and OpenFunction accepted by CNCF Sandbox, with Fluent Operator donated to the Fluent community. CNCF and the upstream community powers and vitalizes our projects.

## Partners

In 2022, we were happy to partner with more organizations to diversify our app ecosystem, and a key feature KubeSphere delivers is the App Store and full life cycle management of apps. For example, we've joined hands with GitLab, Pulsar, OpenELB, Meshery, Crane, DeepFlow, Databend, and CurveFS, and their services are available in the KubeSphere App Store. We appreciate all the efforts of our partners.

</div>

From KubeSphere 4.0.0, we will provide a plug-in architecture, and any third-party partner or independent software vendor (ISV) can develop extensions on top. KubeSphere will provide a consistent UI experience for these features to build a robust app ecosystem. The business logic behind can be equivalent to the bondship between macOS and App Store. Enterprises and organizations can roll out their plug-ins to the KubeSphere App Store to meet user requirements of all types, partnering with QingCloud in the community and business for win-win results.

As the extensions go diversified, we expect to offer you a wider range of services to choose from, helping you build a container platform tailored for custom requirements.

## Contributors

In 2022, our KubeSphere community has grown at a steady pace and attracted more contributors than the previous year. Let's give a shout-out to all contributors!

### 2022 KubeSphere Members

This year, we have two new KubeSphere Members. This certificate is awarded to those who have deeply contributed to our community. For example, they have independently developed or tested one or more features, or written documents.

In the upcoming year, we expect more contributors to advance to members. If you have created one or more significant pull requests in our special interest groups (SIGs), or developed one or more features within half a year, go to our GitHub repo and click [Issues](https://github.com/whenegghitsrock/community/issues) to apply.

> In our forum, we've created a page to archive [all certificates](https://docs.kubesphere-carryon.top/forum/d/9280-kubesphere). Come and claim your own! For our next step, we plan to create a page on our official website, and then you can download your certificates there.

Many thanks to all KubeSphere Members, Ambassadors, and Contributors in 2022, and we expect to see more community members to join us and contribute to open source!

## By the Numbers

In 2022, our community grew at a more stable rate after reaching a saturation point last year, and the overall trend was sound and healthy.

## Looking Ahead

In 2022, we were so lucky and grateful to have more contributors and partners, and explored and achieved more in ecological cooperation. Regarding the community, the growth of our user committee went beyond our expectation. We believe this year would be better!

In 2023, we'll launch next-generation KubeSphere 4.0, featuring a plug-in architecture. All community members, partners, and ISVs can develop plug-ins on top of the lightweight kernal KubeSphere Core and build their own cloud native operating systems tailored for custom requirements.

At the same time, we'll roll out contribution guidelines in 2023, to walk you through how to contribute to open source and our community!
